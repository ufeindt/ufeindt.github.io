In my free time, I play and collect tabletop games, mostly board and role-playing games. Often when I encounter a repetitive task in a game I play a lot, I will apply my coding skills to development tools that will help me. Further I have previously hosted and managed a website that allowed player from across the globe to play Twilight Imperium, an epic space-opera board game, by forum. In the future, I plan to add a blog to this website, detailing my recent hobby projects, which will not be limited to games and software development but may also include cooking and baking recipes, as well as knitting and crochet patterns.
