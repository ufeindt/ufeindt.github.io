During my studies of physics and astronomy and subsequent work as a postdoctoral researcher, I analyzed data from varied astronomical sources. I mainly focused on type Ia supernovae, the remarkably common and remarkably uniform explosions of a binary stars, which allow us to measure the expansion of the universe. I used statistical inference to build better methods for measuring the expansion as well as detecting deviations from our standard model of how the universe evolves. In addition to that I applied machine learning algorithms to clean up the data we obtain from various observatories and developed software allowing us to predict the outcome of astronomical survey based on a propose survey strategy. Today, may work focuses less on data science but I retain a keen interest in the field and strive to apply my knowledge where I can.
