I started programming in Python about 11 years ago when I began working on my Master's thesis. Since then it has been my language of choice for most purposes. During my academic career, I have contributed to several Python packages and release some of my own code as open-source software. Lately, especially after leaving academia for the tech industry, I have also picked up front-end development using Javascript/Typescript and HTML/CSS via frameworks such as Angular and React in order to build interfaces to access data.
