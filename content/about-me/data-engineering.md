I have been working with data for more than a decade, and while I was often focused on analyzing the data, there have always data engineering task in my work, most commonly the ingress and transformation of astronomical data. After leaving academia, my tasks have shifted even more to the engineering side of data, including the development and maintenance of databases and data pipelines, extracting, transforming, and loading consumer product and review data.
