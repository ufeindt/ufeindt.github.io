profile:
  I am a fullstack web developer with a background in data science and 
  engineering, including research experience in astrophysics. Currently
  working in Django and React. Skilled in statistics, machine learning,
  programming, problem solving, and creative thinking. I love tackling
  challenging problems, not just in order to solve them, but also because
  of the new methods I may have to learn or develop, and the fascinating
  people I might meet through collaboration.
experience:
  - title: Backend Developer
    employer: Hem Design Studio, Stockholm, Sweden
    from: 2022-02
    description: 
      "As the only backend developer in a small tech team, I am working closely
      with the digital product manager and frontend developer on maintaining and
      expanding the online store for this small Swedish design furniture studio."
    items:
      - The main backend is a Django (Python) app connecting the third-party 
        services, such as Shopify, Microsoft Navision, Airtable, Salesfoce, and
        Klaviyo.
      - Additionally Airtable serves as our Product Information Manager (PIM),
        for which I develop and maintain automations and extensions (in Javascript).
      - Furthermore, I maintain and develop the data pipeline consolidating sales 
        and marketing data in our Data Warehouse in Google BigQuery using Stitch and
        dbt.
  - title: Data/Software Engineer
    employer: ValueChecker.net / alaTest.com, Stockholm, Sweden
    from: 2020-03
    until: 2022-01
    description: 
      "As a developer at a startup, my work was not confined to a job title. My
      tasks for ValueChecker, a platform helping insurances finding
      replacements for claimed items fairly and transparently, included:"
    items:
      - Full stack development for Angular front end with a Python API hosted
        in Google Cloud, accessing MySQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and Redis.
      - Analysis of product data and improvements to the replacement 
        suggestion logic for items that have been discontinued.
      - Maintenance and (occasional) development of the legacy code in Python,
        Java, and PHP for alaTest, a product review platform, that provides
        additional product data to ValueChecker.
  - title: Researcher
    employer: Stockholms universitet, Sweden
    from: 2015-08
    until: 2019-09
    description:
      I studied astrophysical events, e.g. supernova explosions, using 
      irregularly sampled time-series data, both in order to understand
      individual events and their statistical properties. My responsibilities
      included both obtaining the data through astronomical observations, and
      analyzing it using various statistical methods, most commonly
      model-based regression analyses. Furthermore I developed software to
      simulate and better plan the observations, coordinated an international
      scientific work group and co-supervised students at various levels, from
      Bachelor to PhD.
  - title: Visiting Researcher
    employer: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA 
    from: 2017-05
    until: 2017-09
    description:
      During this research visit, I worked on the commissioning of the Zwicky
      Transient Facility, a project to discover exploding stars throughout the
      Northern Sky. I contributed to the development of a web application that
      allows researchers across the globe to access and visualize the
      telescope data. Additionally, I participated in the discovery of the
      first optical counterpart to a gravitational wave event, analyzing the
      telescope data using various theoretical models and regression analyses.
  - title: Research Assistant
    employer: Humboldt-Universit채t zu Berlin, Germany
    from: 2014-06
    until: 2015-07
    description:
      This position was a continuation of my work in Bonn near the end of my
      PhD program, in which I performed further statistical tests on various
      astronomical data sets and wrote my thesis.
  - title: Research Assistant
    employer: Universit채t Bonn, Germany
    from: 2011-12
    until: 2014-05
    description:
      I was responsible for my own independent research in my PhD project,
      while also contributing to the observations and data analysis of an
      international collaboration. Additionally, I worked as a teaching
      assistant for physics and numerics courses for undergrad students.
  - title: Laboratory Associate
    employer: Yale University, New Haven, USA
    from: 2012-01
    until: 2012-03
    description:
      During this visit, I helped the La Silla QUEST Supernova Search reduce
      the number of false positives in the detection process by applying
      machine learning techniques, mostly boosted decision tree classifiers,
      to data from the image reduction pipeline.
education:
  - title: Dr. rer. nat. (PhD), Physics
    employer: Universit채t Bonn, Gemany
    from: 2011-12
    until: 2015-10
    description:
      My PhD project focused on the question whether astronomical observations
      are statistically the same regardless of the direction. For this study,
      I developed new metrics and hypothesis tests based on time series and
      spectroscopy of supernova events.
  - title: Diplom (MSc), Physics
    employer: Universit채t Bonn, Germany
    from: 2005-10
    until: 2011-11
    description:
      My studies consisted of courses in physics and mathematics with a
      specialization in astronomy and theoretical physics in the later years.
      During the final year of the program I worked on my thesis project on a
      self-calibrating method for statistical inference that can correct
      systematic uncertainties.
