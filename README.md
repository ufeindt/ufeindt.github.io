# My Personal Page

This is my simple personal page based on the [Gatsby default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default). Currently it contains an "About Me" page and my CV. Later I am planning to add a portfolio page and small blog. The content is mostly stored in markdown files, except for the CV data which is stored in a YAML file. The page is built on updates of the `main` branch using a github actions and then deployed to https://ufeindt.github.io.
